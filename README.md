## Introduction and Motivation
Social media holds an important place in our lives and is one of the easiest platforms to access for meeting our daily entertainment needs. The same is true for me, as I also spend time on YouTube throughout the day. 

Over the years, the content, categories, and watch durations of the videos I have watched and interacted have changed during different periods. Through this project, I plan to analyze changes in my viewing preferences over time, the factors that influence them, and how my watch durations and interactions behave. This project will help me learn more about myself and provide an opportunity to practice data analysis.

## Dataset Description
The dataset for this project is my personal YouTube watch history, downloaded using **Google Takeout**. 

The dataset includes:
- Video titles
- Channels
- Timestamps
- URLs 

The data is provided in JSON format.

## Project Idea
The project aims to analyze my YouTube watch history to understand my viewing habits. The main goal is to:
- Identify changes in my viewing habits over time
- Examine the types of videos I watch and interacted
- Detect patterns that may be linked to external events

## Project Plan
I will follow these steps throughout my project:

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Examine the JSON file of my watch history provided by Google Takeout.
- Use the **YouTube Data API** to fetch additional information about the videos I watched.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Clean the data if necessary to ensure it is ready for analysis.
- Prepare the dataset to work with more efficiently.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Perform exploratory data analysis, including:
- **Time series analysis**: Analyze viewing trends over time.
- **Category analysis**: Examine the types of videos watched and their changes over time.
- **Channel analysis**: Identify the channels that are watched most frequently.
- **Correlation with external events**: Investigate potential correlations between viewing habits and external events.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
- Visualize the data using charts and graphs to better understand trends and patterns.

### 5. **Machine Learning**
- Apply machine learning models to identify patterns and predict future viewing interests.

### 6. **Findings and Interpretation**
- Present key findings.
- Provide interpretations based on the analysis.
